# Introduction
I started this is a project for making NVIDIA Jetbot playing soccer. I mainly use a Gazebo of ROS for traning Jetbot to play soccer. Traning Deep Learning algorithm is Reinforcmenet Learning. Thus, I need a virtual environment. After training, the trained model is moved to the actual Jetbot. I need to check that kind of approach will work well.

<img src="image/POM_Jetson.png"> <strong>I get a prize from NVIDIA for this project!</strong>

You can see a original Jetbot related code at https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetbot_ros/tree/master/gazebo. But, there is no URDF file of Jetbot which is needed for simulating a robot in Gazebo. Thus, I change SDF file of Jetbot to URDF. 

And all code are based on ROS URDF official tutorial http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_urdf where you can learn how to simulate a robot in Gazebo. I just chanage a simple 3-linkage, 2-joint arm robot of tutorial to Jetbot. 

I will upload a detailed post to https://kimbring2.github.io/2019/10/26/jetbot.html. Please see it if you need more information about code. 

# Python version
Currently, Gazebo only can be operated on Python 2.7. Thus, you should use a 2.7 version environment.

# Python package
I use a tensorflow-gpu==1.13.1 for neural network part. And opencv-python, cvlib(1.8.0), requests, progressbar, keras is neeed for soccer ball detection.

# How to manually send a wheel velocity commands
The range of velocity that can be given to the wheel is 0 to 100.

## Left Wheel 
For robot1
```rostopic pub -1 /robot1/joint1_velocity_controller/command std_msgs/Float64 "data: 30"```

For robot2
```rostopic pub -1 /robot2/joint1_velocity_controller/command std_msgs/Float64 "data: 30"```

## Right Wheel
For robot1
```rostopic pub -1 /robot1/joint2_velocity_controller/command std_msgs/Float64 "data: 30"```

For robot2
```rostopic pub -1 /robot2/joint2_velocity_controller/command std_msgs/Float64 "data: 30"```

# Python code for Gazebo Simulator
Move to 'jetbot/jetbot_control/src/' folder and type ```python main.py```. 
It will send a velocity command to each wheel and show a camera sensor image. Furthermore, Tensorflow code for Reinforcement Learning is implemented. Jetbot is able to only learn how to track a soccer ball at now. However, I train more advanced behavior after finishing first task.

If you run a code, it will store a Tensorflow weight file at drqn folder of your workspace. 

# Python code for real Jetbot
First, set up ROS in actual Jetbot hardware based on manual of https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetbot_ros.

Then run roscore on Jetbot terminal and publish the camera frame using jetbot_camera node.
```
$ roscore 
$ rosrun jetbot_ros jetbot_camera 
```

You can control a wheel motor using below Python script. 
```
$ rosrun jetbot_ros jetbot_soccer_motors.py 
$ rostopic pub -1 /jetbot_soccer_motors/cmd_str std_msgs/String --once "30"
```

You can control a roller and solenoid motor using two Python script. 
```
$ rosrun jetbot_ros jetbot_soccer_roller.py 
$ rostopic pub -1 /jetbot_soccer_roller/cmd_str std_msgs/String --once "in"
$ rostopic pub -1 /jetbot_soccer_roller/cmd_str std_msgs/String --once "out"
```

```
$ rosrun jetbot_ros jetbot_soccer_solenoid.py 
$ rostopic pub -1 /jetbot_soccer_solenoid/cmd_str std_msgs/String --once "in"
$ rostopic pub -1 /jetbot_soccer_solenoid/cmd_str std_msgs/String --once "out"
```

After that, when the uploaded jetbot_ros.py file is executed, it is possible to receive the camera frame as an input and output the speed of the left and right motors as an input in the same manner as one method in Gazebo.
```$ python jetbot_ros.py ```

In this code, the part that detected the soccer ball using cvlib can be done with Jetson board using jetson.utils, jetson.inference. To see this, look at the jetbot_soccer_main.py file. This file uses Jetson Inference's detecNet to find objects in the image file coming from the jetbot_camera ROS node.

# Tensorflow model freezing for TensorRT inference
Tensorflow model trained using Gazebo simulation can be used without installing Tensorflow on Jetson Nano. However, the saved model needs to be freezing by using first part of 'RL_model_froze.ipynb'. You need to change a 'model_dir = "/home/kimbring2/catkin_ws/src/jetbot/jetbot_control/src/drqn"' line for your workplace setting.

<img src="image/jetbot_frozen_graph.png" width="600">

You should check a inference output at bottom of cell and modify 'model-1.cptk.meta' for your checkpoint name.

# Modify Jetbot for soccer
I am currently remodeling Jetbot's hardware because it is not suitable for soccer. The new Jetbot will secure a soccer ball and kick it. The wheels will also be changed to omniwheel type for moving more freely. Batterie and WiFi antennas of previous Jetbot seem to be reused for saving money.

<img src="/image/jetbot_soccer_proto_1.png" width="600">

There are two main types of equipment. They are divided for kicking and holding soccer ball. I am currently using the Onshape cloud service to create a model, so if you go to that link you will be able to see the work status.

[Modified Jetbot Onshape link](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/242e5d0f2f1cbff393c8e507/w/37c9eecd4ded31866f99420c/e/9a6f236fb48a5317e2b639700)

[![Protoype test 1](https://img.youtube.com/vi/zNTldaCe1ZQ/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/zNTldaCe1ZQ "Jetbot Soccer Play - Click to Watch!")
<strong>Click to Watch!</strong>

I complete design, production and assembly of prototype. Thus, I need to convert the 3D model of Onshape into a model for Gazebo simulation and make a code for controlloing Dynamixel.

# Dynamixel SDK test
The best way to use Dynamixel on Jetson Nano is to use the SDK provided by Robotis.

1. Check your connection between motor and control board(I recommend checking a operation of motor using Dynamixel Wizard).
2. First, download a SDK from 'https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/DynamixelSDK.git' to your Jetson Nano.
3. Move to 'DynamixelSDK/python/tests/protocol1_0' and run 'ping.py' first. I should show a return like a below picture
<img src="/image/dynamixel_ping_test.png" width="600">

4. Open 'read_write.py' using a text editor and change a paramter for MX-12W(You can also change a parameter using Dynamixel Wizard).
<img src="/image/rw_setting.png" width="600">

5. Run 'read_write.py' and you should see a success return like a below picture.
<img src="/image/rw_success.png" width="600">

Please check it for all motor of each wheel.

# RViz test for Jetbot soccer version
You can see a RViz 3D Model of Jetbot soccer using below command.
```
roslaunch jetbot_description jetbot_soccer_rviz.launch
```

After launching a RViz, you can control of each wheel and roller using dialog box.

# Gazebo test for Jetbot soccer version
After checking a Jetbot soccer version at RViz, try to control it at Gazebo simulation.

```
roslaunch jetbot_gazebo main_soccer.launch
```

You can control of each wheel, roller, solenoid motor using 'rostopic pub' command.
First, adjust the speed of the wheels to approach to the ball.

1. Command for wheel motor
```
rostopic pub -1 /robot1/wheel1_velocity_controller/command std_msgs/Float64 "data: 30"
rostopic pub -1 /robot1/wheel2_velocity_controller/command std_msgs/Float64 "data: 30"
rostopic pub -1 /robot1/wheel3_velocity_controller/command std_msgs/Float64 "data: 30"
rostopic pub -1 /robot1/wheel4_velocity_controller/command std_msgs/Float64 "data: 30"
```

Next, rotate a roller motor to pull the ball.

2. Command for roller motor
```
rostopic pub -1 /robot1/roller_velocity_controller/command std_msgs/Float64 "data: 30"
```

Finally kick the ball via speed control of solenoid motor.

3. Command for solenoid motor
```
rostopic pub -1 /robot1/stick_velocity_controller/command std_msgs/Float64 "data: 30"
```

If you run a 'main_soccer.py file in jetbot/jetbot_control file, you can give a command by typing a character.
```
s : stop
f : forward
l : left
r : right
h : hold ball
k : kick ball
```

Please check blog for video of blog for wacthing how to give a command(https://kimbring2.github.io/2019/10/26/jetbot.html#soccer_robot_design_simulation)

# Teleoperation for Jetbot soccer version
Like the original version of Jetbot, Jetbot soccer version can be controlled by gamepad. You can check a code for that teleoperation_soccer.ipynb file. Upload it to Jetson Nano and run it.

[![Teleoperation test](https://img.youtube.com/vi/vONoIruznlw/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vONoIruznlw "Jetbot Soccer Play - Click to Watch!")
<strong>Click to Watch!</strong>

You can use the gamepad for performing the basic actions for soccer. Multi players will be able to play robot soccer together if power of robot is a bit more reinforced. It is little weak for playing real soccer.
